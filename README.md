## Installation
To run this project, clone this repo to a folder on your local machine/development server and run this commands simultaneously:
```shell
python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The following is what happens when you run this command:
- A virtual environment is created. This creates an isolated environment where you can install libraries and scripts away from your default Python installation.
- The next command activates your virtual environment
- The last command installs the required libraries to run the project

Note that before you run this set of commands above, open the client directory and run
```shell
npm i
```
This would install the dependencies for the client section of the project

## Usage

To use the app, run
```shell
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:server
```
This runs the app using gunicorn, a popular Python WSGI server. Ensure you exectue this command at the root of the project.
